### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

"We rise by lifting others." This is one quote that I've always lived by and the idea that you can thrive professionally and personally simply by helping your peers so that we can all stride towards a better tomorrow has been a driving force in my life which has helped me be brave and pursue my dreams and work towards making a difference in the society along with achieving everything that i aspire to in the near future. 

During my time in Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI), I've not only learnt how to work in difficult circumstances but also learnt to move out of my comfort zone and pick up skills for the betterment of the delivery of KPI's. It's been such a beautiful journey that helped me develop my skills to automate core SAP business processes using Selenium, HP UFT, Ui Path, SAP CBTA along with various web based applications and catalogs. As a Business Analyst, I was responsible for querying customer data on a monthly basis for the analysis and optimization of various client KPI's by simplifying the data and providing visualisations for the same using Google Dashboards. I've also been a part of the auditing process and was on the technical interview panel for Automation team recruitment in LTI. 

When i was playing around with queries, excel master sheets and dashboards, that's when I realised that Business Intelligence and Data Analytics interests me. So here i am, miles away from my home country pursuing my Master's in Big Data Science with Machine Learning at QMUL along with interning at Emarsys which is an SAP company as their new Marketing Data Analyst (Intern). I help simplify and analyze their data on basis of Zendesk ticketing and Data warehousing of various email marketing campaigns. I was new to the whole Email Marketing Domain but over the past months, I've gotten well versed with the metrics which has helped me analyze better.

In the near future, I see myself as the Lead of Business Intelligence and Data Analytics and have my plate full of data to untangle and unwind and use my creativity in resolving data issues by diving into the BI perspective of it and would love to work in an environment that radiates nothing but growth in both professional and personal aspects of life.

Enough with the data talk already!
